# A8: Linked Lists

* This assignment is to implement:
  * singly_linked.hpp

  * circularly_linked.hpp

  * doubly_linked.hpp

* Starter code with implementation instructions is given in the respective .hpp files

* main.cpp has an example including expected output. However, you should test main with different examples and  special cases before submission.

## Submission

* singly_linked.hpp
* circularly_linked.hpp
* doubly_linked.hpp
* In all of these files your task is to implement functions discussed in the class. However, there are additional functions also:
  * concatenate for SinglyLinkedList

  * reverse for SinglyLinkedList

  * concatenate for DoublyLinkedList

  * splitEven for CircularlyLinkedList

  * These functions must be implemented using pointer links without copy/move operation.
* Please note main.cpp or test.cpp are not required for this assignment. 
* No points will be awarded if instructions are not followed irrespective of autograder passing test cases.
* Please don't submit build/exe files/folder [-2 points]
