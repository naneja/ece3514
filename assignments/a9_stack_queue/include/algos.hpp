/*
Remove Adjacent Duplicates Using Stack
Goal: Remove all adjacent duplicate characters until none remain
Example:
"abbaca" -> "ca"
"abccba" -> ""
Stack Logic:
Iterate over string s:
If stack top = current character, pop from stack (remove pair).
Else, push character onto stack.
Final stack gives the result string.

clean string with Backspace char as <
Use stack to simulate typing
< = backspace -> pop from stack
Typing = push characters onto stack
Edge case: backspace on empty stack
Example:
s = "ab<c" -> stack = ['a', 'c']
t = "ad<c" -> stack = ['a', 'c']

/*
Suppose you have a stack S containing n elements and a queue Q that is
initially empty. 
Describe how you can use Q to scan S to see if it contains a certain element x, with the additional constraint that your algorithm must return the elements back to S in their original order. 
You may not use an array or linked listâ€”only S and Q and a constant number of reference variables.

Scanning a Stack Using a Queue (While Preserving Order)
Goal: Check if element x is in stack S using only:
Stack S, empty queue Q, and constant variables
Preserve original order of S after scan
Steps:

Step 1: Pop from S, enqueue into Q, check for x
Step 2: After scanning, dequeue from Q, push into S
Step 3: Repeat: Pop from S, enqueue into Q (restores original order)
Step 4: Finally, dequeue from Q, push into S

Example:
S = [3, 1, 4] (top to bottom)
x = 1
After scan: S = [3, 1, 4], Q = [], and x found
