## Practice Lab Assignment 5.3.1: Implementing 2D Array using Static Allocation

* In this lab, you will learn how to:
  * Declare and initialize a 2D character array
  * Use nested loops to traverse rows and columns
  * Print a grid (board) format using std::cout
  * Understand how multi-dimensional arrays are stored and accessed

## Background

* A 2D array in C++ is like a table with rows and columns. It is declared using:

```cpp
dataType arrayName[rows][columns];
```

* You can access each element using:

```cpp
arrayName[row][column]
```

* To print all elements, you will use nested loops.

## Problem Statement

* Create a C++ program that declares a 3×5 character board. Initializes it with the following letters

```sh
I N R O W
M A J O R
O R D E R
```

* Prints the board **row by row**, with spaces between each character.

## Challenge

* Count how many times the letter 'O' appears in the board and print:The letter O appears X times.
